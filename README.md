# CodeAplha_tasks
developed a project using python for CodeAlpha internship
Task 1:
Description
This is a simple implementation of the classic Hangman Game using Python. The game allows the player to guess letters in a hidden word, and they have a limited number of wrong guesses before they "lose."
Features
Word is randomly chosen from a predefined list.
The player can guess letters one by one.
The game shows the current state of the word after each guess.
The player has a limited number of incorrect guesses (e.g., 6 chances).
The player can either win or lose based on their guesses.
RequirementsHow to Play
When the game starts, a random word is selected, and you will see underscores representing the letters in the word.
Guess one letter at a time by typing it when prompted.
If the guessed letter is in the word, it will be revealed in the word.
If the guessed letter is not in the word, you lose one chance.
You win if you guess all the letters of the word before running out of chances.
Python 3.x or later.

Task 2:
Description
This is a simple chatbot built using Python. The chatbot is designed to simulate a conversation with the user, answer common questions, and provide basic functionality such as responding to greetings, asking about the weather, and performing basic calculations.
Features
A conversational interface that responds to user input.
Uses predefined rules to provide responses to common phrases.
Supports basic functionalities like weather inquiries, simple math operations, and more.
Ability to add additional features or integrate with external APIs.
Requirements
Python 3.x or later.
nltk (Natural Language Toolkit) library for basic text processing.
Optionally, requests for API integrations (e.g., weather updates).
How to Run
Run the chatbot script:
bash
Copy
python chatbot.py
The chatbot will prompt you to type a message. You can start chatting with it.

Task 3:
Stock Portfolio Tracker - CodeAlpha Internship
Description
This Python-based Stock Portfolio Tracker allows users to manage their stock investments by tracking the current prices of their portfolio, calculating gains or losses, and providing a summary of the portfolio's performance. The tool fetches live stock data using an API and allows users to keep track of their stock holdings and make informed decisions.
Features
Track multiple stocks in a portfolio.
Fetch live stock prices from an external API.
Calculate the total value of the portfolio based on the current stock prices.
Calculate the profit or loss for each stock and the overall portfolio.
Display portfolio summary with details of each stock and performance.
Requirements
Python 3.x or later.
requests library to fetch stock data from an API.
pandas for data handling and calculations (optional but recommended).
API Key from a stock data provider (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Yahoo Finance, or IEX Cloud).
How to Run
Run the main portfolio tracker script:
bash
Copy
python stock_portfolio.py
Input your stock ticker symbols (e.g., AAPL, GOOG, TSLA), number of shares, and purchase prices.

The script will fetch the latest stock prices and provide an updated summary of your portfolio.
